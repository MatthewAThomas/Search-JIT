# Search-JIT

This project uses JIT compilation speed up search algorithms. It is inspired by the article ["A method for JITâ€™ing algorithms and data structures with LLVM"](https://blog.christianperone.com/2009/11/a-method-for-jiting-algorithms-and-data-structures-with-llvm/). 

Currently, only basic BST search algorithms are being explored, though other types of algorithms and data structures may be explored in the future.


## bst
The binary search tree directory contains 1) a rudimentary implementation of a binary search tree (**bst/bst-data**), and 2) a "JITed" version of a binary search tree (**bst/bst-ir**). The aformentioned article explains what it means to JIT a BST, and why one might want to do so.

In the **bst** directory, the provided **benchmark.c** file benchmarks the performance of a JITed BST and a traditional BST. **benchmark.c** first inserts a certain number of elements into each tree and then queries for a certain number of values from each tree. The elements to be inserted into the trees are specified in **benchmark-utils/data.c** - this file is generated by **benchmark-utils/generate_data.py**. Likewise, the values used to query the trees are in **benchmark-utils/queries.c**, which is generated by **benchmark-utils/generate_queries.py**. To create/modify the **data.c** and **queries.c** files, run *python generate_[data/queries].py n* in the benchmark-utils directory (where *n* is the number of items to insert/query).

To build, you will need [LLVM installed](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html) with the LLVM-C API, and you will need Python installed. This project is using LLVM version 21.0.0.
