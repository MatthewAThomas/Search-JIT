This project uses runtime code generation to speed up search algorithms. It is inspired by the article "A method for JITâ€™ing algorithms and data structures with LLVM": https://blog.christianperone.com/2009/11/a-method-for-jiting-algorithms-and-data-structures-with-llvm/. 

Currently, only basic BST search algorithms are being explored, though other types of algorithms and data structures may be explored in the future.
